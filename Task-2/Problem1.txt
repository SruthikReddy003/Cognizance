Divisiblity of a Number(N) by 3 without using modulus operator explicitly

Import the scanner class  
Make an object sc for Scannerclass as a System input
Make the object sc to scan N as an integer

While N is greater than 0
	Subtract 3 from N
  if N is equal to zero
	print "True"
  else
	print "False"
