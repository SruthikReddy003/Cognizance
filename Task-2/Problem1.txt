Divisiblity of a Number(num) by 3 without using modulus operator explicitly

Import the scanner class  
Initialize num to 0
Make an object sc for Scannerclass as a System input
Make the object sc to scan num as an integer

While num is greater than 0
	Subtract 3 from num
  if num is equal to zero
	print "True"
  else
	print "False"
