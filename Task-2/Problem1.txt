Divisiblity of a Number(num) by 3 without using modulus operator explicitly

Import the scanner class  
Initialize num to 0
Make an object sc for Scannerclass as a System input
Make the object sc to scan num as an integer

While num is greater than 0
	Subtract 3 from num
  if num is equal to zero

step 1: START 
>>>>>>> master

step 2: DISPLAY Enter a number : 
step 3: number = INPUT 
step 4: READ number
step 5: Initialize a to zero
step 6: Initialize i to zero

step 7.0: FOR (,i less than or equal to number,increment i every loop)
       DO 
     7.1: a=a+3

     7.2: IF a = number THEN
     7.3: break the loop
     7.4: END IF

step 8: END FOR

step 9.0: IF a = number THEN 
     9.1: Print True  

step 10.0: ELSE
     10.1:  Print False 

step 11: END IF

step 12: STOP
