Pseudocode for printing Nth Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

F0 = 0 and F1 = 1

//MATHEMATICAL CODE//
Fn = (Fn-1) + (Fn-2)

//PSEUDOCODE FOR FIBONACCI SEQUENCE//

step 1: START 

step 2: Initialize a to zero
step 3: Initialize b to one
step 4: Initialize c to zero

step 5: DISPLAY Enter a number : 
step 6: n=INPUT
step 7: READ n

step 8.0: for (Initialize i to 2,i is less than n,increment i every loop) 
     8.1: SET c=a+b
     8.2: SET a=b
     8.3: SET b=c
